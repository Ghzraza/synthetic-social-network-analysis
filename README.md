# Synthetic Social Network Analysis

**Author:** Ghazal Raza  
**Purpose:** Demonstrates temporal network analysis, clustering, and AI-based predictive modeling of synthetic interactions. Methods are explicitly transferable to computational neuroscience and ethological social dynamics research at the Labonté Laboratory, Université Laval.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete workflow for:

1. **Synthetic network generation:** Nodes and edges represent agents, analogous to neurons or individual mice in social colonies.
2. **Temporal evolution simulation:** Network structure evolves over time, mimicking longitudinal neuronal activity or social interactions.
3. **Community detection and clustering:** Identifies emergent modules, analogous to neuronal ensembles or social clusters.
4. **AI-based predictive modeling:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) predict future network states, serving as an in silico model for circuit or social dynamics.
5. **Visualization:** Temporal network snapshots and predicted adjacency matrices for interpretable analysis.

## Labonete lab Transferability

### 1. Computational Neuroscience & Circuit Biology
- **Network Modeling:** Synthetic nodes/edges = neurons and their functional connectivity in mPFC.
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Network evolution = recruitment of neuronal ensembles across behavioral tasks.
- **Clustering:** Emergent communities = functional neuronal ensembles.
- **Predictive AI:** RNN predictions = in silico modeling of neuronal responses and circuit dynamics.

### 2. Neuroethological Social Dynamics
- **Social Network Analog:** Synthetic agents = mice in ethological environments.
- **Temporal Evolution & Clustering:** Mirrors social consolidation, interaction patterns, and stress-induced reorganization.
- **AI Prediction:** Predicts trajectories of social interactions under baseline or environmental challenges.

This repository demonstrates **method literacy** in the computational tools and approaches used in both Labonté Lab projects:  
- Network construction and analysis  
- Temporal evolution of networks  
- Community detection  
- AI-driven prediction of future states
